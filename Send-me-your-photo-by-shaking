# Send me your photo by shaking
This is a backup repository for the course ECE 150/251 (UCSB 2016 Winter).
# Specification
This project involves recording the inertial information, establishing a Wi-Fi Direct connection and transferring files between two Android devices. Develop an app that can scan available nearby Android devices that support Wi-Fi Direct when you shake your phone. Once the request published by another peer is discovered, the app initiates a Wi-Fi P2P (Direct) connection with the selected peer. If the connection is successfully established, the app can send files (e.g. jpg files) to another. Finally, the app needs to stop scanning peers once the communication is disconnected.
The following screenshots illustrate the steps required for this app. You can find a demo video here [here](https://youtu.be/Wb_Az4IoPmg)
